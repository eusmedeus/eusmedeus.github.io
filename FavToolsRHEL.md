# Introduction
Hey, just to keep this short, without much explanation, a list of tools I personally use to make my life as a Sysadmin easier. I'm not yet too sure about the order of things, but we'll figure this out as we go.

#General

#For Windows
Tools I basically use on every Windows machine

## 1password
Ok this is probably the only tool in here which has a subscription (pay) model - but seriously:
If you don't have a password manager by now - get it.

And **no** _I dont get money from 1password_ or anything just my opinion only here.
If you ask me the best Password manager 2021.

## MremoteNG
This one may be a bit special to some not too familiar with IT.
It helps me Manage all sort of remote connections and find my way through them.

Basically It's like the bookmarks in your browser just way more
I can even use my Putty configurations and thats it.

Got to admit though, recently thanks to annother "tool" called Ansible it's getting less and less important

## Putty
This tool has mainly 2 purposes for me for one it helps me create and use a private key as well as make use of ssh connections originating from Windows. Or simply put, to administer Linux machines, this tool should be your very basic.

Oh and don't forget to grab a font package called "Powerline fonts" you'll probably thank me later. Or not.
But when you're using a shell you might soon discover a new world of things (don't get my inner nerd talking here shoosh!)

## Atom
Okay where to begin with this one..
Basically this is my main text/project/workwith tool on a daily basis both private and Professional.

Let's just assume that every piece of a program or app, picture or whatever it is - in its core it is basically a file.
Atom will help you make use of that file, either with addons or syntax help or... well its just there to be awesome <3.

So just to name a few things:
- it has some really fancy add-ons.
- it's free
- it works with the git protocol even though it might have some issues with branches the basic push/pull/commit is easy as pie
- it supports folder structures - heck i'm mostly doing this blog in Atom right now (PS autocorrect is still a B*tch)

**Hint:** check out multi-cursor

## Notepad++
Since Atom I tend not to use notepad++ less often nowadays. Yetthe cases I use it, Atom is at a loss.
At the moment its either comparing 2 text files in a sort of side by side view or its simply a huge text file any other text editor takes forever to load.

Also its Text search (and replace) function is pretty neat.

## 7Zip
So everyone knows zip packages right? How about rar or is this just a relict for old peeps like me?
Anyhow try opening .tar on windows or lets say .tar.gz2 to put this one quick its your swiss knife for compressing/de-compressing files.

## Winscp
Well Uploading/Downloading files via ssh or sftp to be more precise, there you go. Also Supports your putty keyfile ;)
