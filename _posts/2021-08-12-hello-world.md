# Why?

Well **I** thought about doing a blog for a 'long time' now, so why not ?
You **don't have to read it** - so if you don't like this [leave](https://eusmedeus.github.io)

Ok - that is a very _bad_ joke, even for my tastes. Anyhow, lets get on with it

#Seriously why though

Actually I **did** think about blogging for quite some time (basicly like anyone who's ever written blogs)
but never knew what to do with it (yep, real fresh approach incoming!).

For the most part I like the technical aspect of it.
So today upon discovering **[this git project](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll#readme)** I decided to just start one and go with it (whatever this means).

## what can you (person who probably never reads this article) expect

Out of place Humor... I think.
yep thats _IT_ move along now (Drag up your feed the jokes ain't forced but they're comin real low).

Maybe also a bit of tech stuff, something about games and maybe a few stories buuuut lets face it - this is probably yet another tech Blog **yay!**

# who doesnt _looooooove_ tech blogs
...

# Exactly

(what am I doing here...)
