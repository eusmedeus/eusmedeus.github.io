# Thoughts
So since dicovering [this project](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll#readme) yesterday, I couldn't help but wonder - do people still read blogs?
I mean apart from folks who is at least remotely interested in Tech.

Still I didn't approach this in search for some internet fame, for such things the web has become way to toxic in my opionion.

I'd rather just have a place for people who search for a specific topic (dunno "what is $ITTOPIC for beginners") and be happy about what they find.
While I say this, I got to admit, that it is in fact, pretty intimidating, reading other blogs like listening to college teachings :D

Some are like specified on one topic and therefore collect and post a lot of knowledge where one automatically, unconciously feels inferior.
Yet no one, not even the most pros in there field know everything there is.

With that mindset, I think I'll start collecting few little this and thats on this page, hopeing it will someday help someone.
Even made my first collection of tools I use on a daily basis as an item on the main page

P.S. My other half suggested to write something about AI and well, see this post ? **Waaaaay** less effort way more fun than starting to research all there is to AI now :P

yours truly
