# Introduction
Hey, just to keep this short, without much explanation, a list of tools I personally use to make my life as a Sysadmin easier.
I'm not yet too sure about the order of things, but we'll figure this out as we go.

# General

# For Windows
Tools I basically use on every Windows machine

## 1password
Ok this is probably the only tool in this list which uses a subscription model (pay) - but seriously:
If you don't have a password manager by now - **get one**.

And **no** _I dont get money from 1password_ or anything just my opinion only here.
If you ask me the best Password manager 2021.

## MremoteNG
This one may be a bit special to some not too familiar with IT.
It helps me to manage all sort of remote connections and find my way through them, simply put it's like the bookmarks in your browser just way more.

I can use my Putty configurations, add specific icons create a folder structure and add connection details.
Also it comes with some options to export/import your "bookmarks" manually or via sql but I never used or needed it.

Got to admit though, recently thanks to another "tool" called Ansible it's getting less and less important

## Putty
This tool has mainly two purposes for me.
One it helps me create and use my private key.
Two, make use of ssh connections originating from Windows. Or simply put, to administer Linux machines, this tool should be your very basic.

Oh and don't forget to grab a font package called "Powerline fonts" you'll probably thank me later.
Or not.
Depends, but when you're using a shell you might soon discover a new world of things (don't get my inner nerd talking here shoosh!)

## Atom
Okay where to begin with this one..
This is my main text/project/work-with tool on a daily basis both private and professional.

Let's just assume that every piece of a program or app, picture or whatever it is - in its core it is a file, somehow.

Atom will help you make use of that file, either with add-ons or syntax help or... well its just there to be awesome ‚ù§.

So just to name a few things it does:
- it has some really fancy add-ons.
- it's open source
- it works with the git protocol even though it might have some issues with branches the basic pull/commit/push is as easy as pie
- it supports folder structures - heck i'm mostly doing this blog in Atom right now (PS autocorrect is still there to drive gears)

**Hint:** check out multi-cursor

## Notepad++
Since Atom I tend not to use notepad++ that often nowadays. Yet the cases I use it, Atom is mostly to slow.
At the moment it's either comparing 2 text files in a sort of side by side view or its simply a huge text file (logs) any other (Windows) text editor takes forever to load.

Also its Text search (and replace) function is pretty neat.

## 7Zip
So everyone knows zip packages right? How about rar or is this just a relict for old peeps like me?
Anyhow try opening .tar on windows or lets say .tar.gz2 to put this one quick its your swiss knife for compressing/de-compressing files.

## Winscp
Well Uploading/Downloading files via ssh or sftp to be more precise, there you go.
Also Supports your putty keyfile, thats all there is to it.

## Linux Subsystem for Windows (WSL)
Well some might argue that alot of the above mentioned can also be achived using, wsl.
However I never really grew warm with it therefore I stick to my tools but it's a more than valid option and if you use it or plan to used
it you might want to consider taking a look at my Linux Tool list (not decided on the name yet).



Thats it for now, I plan to write up articles on how to do different IT things with the stuff mentioned in this list but thats it for now.
Nope there is also no need to soundfollcribe or whatever. Just hope that someone might find this helpful.
